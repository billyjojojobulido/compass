## Compass 🧭

`Stay on course, even when work drifts.`


**Compass 🧭** is a local-first work log and kanban system designed for individuals.

Unlike team-oriented task managers, Compass is built around a personal perspective:
tracking progress, dependencies, blockers, and unfinished commitments.

All data lives in plain local files.
Tasks can flow across a kanban board, form parent-child structures, and be reflected into weekly logs automatically — helping you stay oriented, even when work becomes fragmented and uncertain.
